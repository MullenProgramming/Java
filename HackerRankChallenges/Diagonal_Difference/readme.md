Given a square matrix, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.  
For example, the square matrix arr is shown below:
```
1 2 3
4 5 6
9 8 9
```
The left-to-right diagonal: `1 + 5 + 9 = 15`.  
The right-to-left diagonal: `3 + 5 + 9 = 17`.  
Their absolute difference is `|15 - 17| = 2`.   


#### Function description
Complete the diagonal difference function with the following parameter:  
- `int arr[n][m]: a 2-D array of integers`    
#### Return
- `int: the absolute difference in sums along the diagonals`  

#### Input Format
The first line contains a single integer, n, the number of rows and columns in the square matrix arr.  
Each of the next n lines describes a row, `arr[i]`, and consists of  space-separated integers `arr[i][j]`.  

#### Constraints
- `-100 < arr[i][j] <= 100`  

#### Sample Input
```
STDIN      Function
-----      --------
3           arr[][] sizes n = 3, m = 3
11 2 4     arr = [[11, 2, 4], [4, 5, 6], [10, 8, -12]]
4 5 6
10 8 -12
```

#### Sample Output
`15`  

#### Explanation
The primary diagonal is:  
```
11
   5
     -12
```
Sum across the primary diagonal: `11 + 5 - 12 = 4`.  
The secondary diagonal is:  
```
     4
   5
10
```
Sum across the secondary diagonal: `4 + 5 + 10 = 19`.  
Difference: `|4 - 19| = 15`.  
  
Note: `|x|` is the absolute value of `x`.
